- **Blade Templating:** Leveraging Blade, Laravel’s templating engine, to create dynamic and reusable views for the website.
- **Security Features:** Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Testing:** Utilizing Laravel's testing tools to ensure the application works correctly and efficiently through unit and feature tests.
